## Introduction

My name is Zhizhou (之洲) Liu (刘). I am now studying in Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China. I am major in Mathematics, interested in many fields of it. I am also interested in *Quant*, having an internship in [Meridian investment company](https://www.meridianglobal.com.cn/main/init) now.

I am happy to having contact with you through Email: liuzz0905@foxmail.com. 

## Interests

- Mathematics

I am open to various aspects of Mathematics. For now, I am just reading some books talking about probability theory. I always feel unsafe to move on if there is still a large confusion on previous course. I guess it would take rather long time for me to reach the level of research.

- Stock Market

I am a faithful *value investor*, holding a few stock rights now, including *By-Health (汤臣倍健，300146.SZ), Muyuan (牧原股份，002714.SZ), Huarun (华润微电子，688396.SH)*.
