## Introduction

My name is Zhizhou (之洲) Liu (刘). I am now studying in Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China. I am major in Mathematics, interested in many fields of it. I am also interested in *Quant*, having an internship in [Meridian investment company](https://www.meridianglobal.com.cn/main/init) now.

I am happy to having contact with you through Email📧: liuzz0905@foxmail.com. 

Forgive me if you cannot understand the Chinese characters. They are all just names.



## Interests

- Mathematics

I am open to various aspects of Mathematics. For now, I am just reading some books talking about probability theory. I always feel unsafe to move on if there is still some confusion on previous course. So I am also review on measure theory and functional analysis. I guess it would take rather long time for me to reach the level of research. Anyway, Mathematics is really charming. I feel fine to ''waste'' some time on it.

- Stock Market

I am a faithful *value investor*, holding a few stock rights in China now, including *By-Health (汤臣倍健，300146.SZ), Muyuan Foods (牧原股份，002714.SZ), China Resources Microelectronics (华润微电子，688396.SH)*.  

- Football

I write football as my interest with frighten here. Due to China's policy to COVID-19, I stayed at home for a whole semester this year. Hope I would not be so weak after one-semester period of absence.
